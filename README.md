# Heart-Attack-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression
This study develops a machine learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict heart attacks. A random state is set to stabilize training and improve precision. Results show that the proposed model performs well and can be a reliable method for heart attack prediction.
