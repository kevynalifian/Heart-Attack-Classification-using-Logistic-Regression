# Heart Attack Classification using Logistic Regression

## Description:
One of the primary causes of death in Indonesia is heart attacks. Therefore, an effective method of pre-diction is required to determine whether a patient is experiencing a heart attack. One efficient approach is to use machine learning models. However, it is still rare to find machine learning models that have good performance in predicting heart attacks. This study aims to develop a machine learning model on Logistic Regression algorithm in predicting heart attack. Logistic Regression is one of the machine learning meth-ods that can be used to study the relationship between a binary response variable [0, 1] and a set of pre-dictor variables, and can be used directly to calculate probabilities. In this study, a random state is ini-tialized in the Logistic Regression model in order to stabilize the training of the machine learning model and increase the precision of the proposed method. The results of this study show that the proposed model can be a method that has good performance in predicting heart attack disease.
